class StallDetector:
    """
    Detects price staleness by identifying both exact price repeats and artificial noise patterns.

    The detection strategy is based on the intuition that meaningful price movements must exceed
    some minimum relative threshold. If a price very slightly fluctuates but doesn't exceed the
    `noise_threshold` within `stall_time_limit`, then it's likely that it's just a static price
    with artificial noise thrown in.

    Detection Logic:
    1. Exact Stalls: Prices within `stall_time_limit` are exactly equal (within float precision)
    2. Noisy Stalls: All price variations stay within a tiny relative `noise_threshold` (default 0.01%)
       for longer than `stall_time_limit`.

    The `noise_threshold` (default 1e-4 or 0.01%) strategy is chosen because:
    - Real price movements, even for very stable symbols, should exceed this threshold.
    - Hard to circumvent. Avoiding detection would require larger variations, impacting the publisher's
      price accuracy versus the aggregate.
    - The threshold is relative to the base price, making it work across different price scales.
    - It works across different noise patterns (random, sine wave, structured, etc.)

    Example:
    - A $100 base price with all variations within Â±$0.01 (0.01%) for 2+ minutes is likely stalled
    - Natural price movements would occasionally exceed this tiny threshold
    - Variations this small consistently over time suggest artificial noise
